    {
       
//        ### Private Fields

//- `_designer` of type `string`. It will hold your name.
//- `_dateConstructed` of type `DateTime`. This will hold the exact time the building was created.
//- `_address` of type string.
//- `_owner` of type string. This will store the name of the person who owns the building.

//### Public Properties

//- `Stories` typed as an integer.
//- `Width` typed as a double.
//- `Depth` typed as a double.
//- `Volume` should be read-only and should return *width* depth * (3 * # of stories)*. Each story is 3 meters high.

//    ### Constructor

//Define a constructor method that accepts a single string argument - `address` - so that you can send as a parameter when you create each instance with `new Building("800 8th Street");`.

//- The constructor’s logic should set the `_address` field’s value to the argument value

//### Public Methods

//- Define a `Construct()` method.The method’s logic should set the `_dateConstructed` field’s value to `DateTime.Now`.
//- Define a `Purchase()` method.The method should accept a single string argument of the name of the person purchasing a building.The method should take that string and assign it to the private `_owner` field.

//Neither of these methods will return a value.
